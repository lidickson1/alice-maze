                    >Robert Abbott</a
                >. The naming comes from a scene in Alice in Wonderland where
                Alice eats a piece of cake with the sign "Eat Me" and grows
                larger, then she drinks from a bottle marked "Drink Me" and
                becomes smaller. This is reflected in the maze where the
                distance you travel in a move will get larger or smaller,
                depending on the colour of the arrows.
            </p>
            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>
                You start a maze on the pink square, and your current position
                is always outlined in green. You must make a series of moves
                that will take you to the goal. You can only move into squares
                according to the arrows in your current square. For example,
                having an arrow pointing to the left means you can move to the
                square left of your current position. You click on a green
                square to move onto it. You may not land on blank squares.
                <br /><br />
                The step size determines the distance you travel per move. When
                the maze begins, your step size is 1. Therefore, if you
                travelled left, you would land 1 square to left of your current
                position. If the step size is 2, you would land 2 squares to the
                left and so on. When you land on a square with red arrows, your
                step size is increased by 1. When you land on a square with
                yellow arrows, your step size is decreased by 1. If the step
                size is 0, then you cannot make anymore moves and the maze is
                over.
                <br /><br />
                The pagination allows you to navigate between the moves you have
                made. You can select a previously made move and change it by
                selecting a different square. Note that this will erase all
                subsequent moves from that point.
